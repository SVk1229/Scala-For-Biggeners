This Repo helps to understand from the Scala Basics to advance level.

1. The Question was asked in one of my interviews, that there are two tables 1.customerdimension 2.customer
customerdimension contains all the records regarding customer i.e. id,name,age,address...etc - 1L records are there
cust file contains only 2 columns id,address, so in both tables having 'custid' common column, and using that 
we have to update the address column in customerdimension.
i have added two solutions for above mentioned problem, one is with programatically specified schema and next one manually specified schema.


2. Tail Recursion using Accumlator in Scala
